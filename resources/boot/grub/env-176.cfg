# Enable cn_mute flag
# ===================
# During initialization in `hammer_time`, the function `pmap_bootstrap` is
# called which will always call `printf` (and thus `cnputc`) on success.
# This requires the `cn_devlist` data structure to be filled by `cninit`.
# However, `cninit` is not called until after `pmap_bootstrap` has returned.
# To prevent this issue, we manually enable the `cn_mute` flag, which will be
# set or unset during `cninit` based on boot flags.
# Values:
# - 0x0  Disable cn_mute
# - 0x1  Enable cn_mute
