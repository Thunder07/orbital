# Adjust PML4 base
# ================
# No idea why would this be ever necessary, but otherwise we get
# crashes while setting `cr3` inside `pmap_bootstrap`.
# For now I'm just adjusting the addend to around 0 so that the final
# PML4 address doesn't land in the wrong place.
# TODO: Find out what the correct addend is.
# Used by: hammer_time.
